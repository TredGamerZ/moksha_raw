                Greetings,
                In the digital world being accelerated by the emerging advancements in gaming and technology, we at Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology have cemented our legacy as one of the premier gaming societies in the Delhi circuit within the short span of one year.
                Therefore in an attempt to establish this very love and passion for gaming, we Venatus-
                The Official Gaming Society of NSIT in association with Paradize Group brings to you our event AIMBOT’18, which is certainly going to infuse within all a sensation of adrenaline pumping fun.
                Gaming is already a mainstream sport, enjoyed by all whether playing or spectating.<br><br>

                Venatus aims to push the boundaries of multiplayer events by introducing new improvised rules and high end specs gear.
                The vision of Aimbot is to professionalize gaming as a career for either development or even publishing.<br>
                The Event will take place in two phases. We tried to include every single mainstream multiplayer game i.e. CSGO, Tekken 7, FIFA 18, Dota 2, NFS MW, Mini Militia (Phone), Real Cricket 07, Sims City – All of them organized with fixed dedicated venue and rules.
                The individual rules and procedure for each game will be out soon on the website as well as on the Facebook page. Google forms will be released, 2 weeks prior the event
