            </p>     
            <!--Rules -->
            <h4 class="fn1 fw my-5">BLIND BOX</h4>
            <p class="lead f2 c-theme-2">
                With this game we are trying to show that how difficult is life for a blind person. Leading a life just by sensing objects, listening to the directions of other people and with the fear of falling is such a difficult task. Still these brave souls live their life. 
            </p>
            <ol class="f2 c-theme-2 p-5 black-box" style="text-space: 3px">
                 There will be a restricted area in which we’ll hide some objects. The game will be played in pairs. One of the team member will be blindfolded and have to find the objects by listening to the instructions of his/her team member who will be outside the restricted area.
                    
            </ol>

            <h4 class="fn1 fw my-5"> DRAMA COMPANY </h4>
            <p class="lead f2 c-theme-2"> 
                With this game we are trying to show the difficulties faced by dumb people to explain what they feel and what they want. They have to depend on other people to understand them and convey their message to others.
 
            </p>
            <ol class="f2 c-theme-2 p-5 black-box" style="text-space: 3px">
                  It will be team game in which all the members will stand in a row. The last member will be given a movie to enact and explain to the immediate next member in the row in the mean while all the other members will be having their back towards them. In the same way every member will enact and try to explain to their immediate next team member. At the end will match the name of the movie which first person enacted and the last person guessed.
                    
            </ol>

            <h4 class="fn1 fw my-5"> LEGS MEET BALLS </h4>
            <p class="lead f2 c-theme-2">
                 This sub event emphasizes on the power of unity and the coordination of the team members. As we all know now a day’s unity lacks in major part of our society so we the Rotaractors through this game are trying to bring out the importance of integrity.
             </p>
            <ol class="f2 c-theme-2 p-5 black-box" style="text-space: 3px">
                 In this game we will tie the hands of all the team members in such a way that they form a circle. We will keep a ball in the centre of this group circle and the members have to coordinate well that the reach the finish line without falling and with that ball in the centre of their group. 
                    
            </ol>
